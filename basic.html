    Tag for contents: <div>, <p>, <span>
        Ex: <div>contents</div>

    <div> is open tag and </div> is close tag.

    *Open tag and close tag must be same
        Ex) <div>content</p> (x), <div>content</div> (o)

    Tag without contents: 
        <br>, <img>, <meta>

    There are no open tag and close tag concepts for tag without contents.

    <br> is called empty tag.

    <!DOCTYPE html>: showing html5 version.

    <html lang="en">
        <html>: Beginning of a html document.
        <html lang="">: Language info for a html file.

    <head>: Info about our html document.
    In <head>: 
        There is meta tag: <meta ~>
        <meta charset="">: For incoding of the document.
        <meta name="viewport": Viewport meta tag.
        <title>: Title for document
        <body>: Anything in <body>, will be dislayed in the web browser.

    *Important: <(tag_name) (element)="(element_value)">
        Element: lang, charset, name, content, href, target, src, alt...etc.
    
    <h(n)>: 
        Heading tag, usually used for important title for contents
        h1 tag is recommended to be used only once in a single html file.
        You don't have to use all h(n) tags (1~6) but must use them sequentially.
        h(n) tag: The most important.
        h1~h3: Usually being used in the industries.
        h(n) tag: The least important.

    <p>: 
        paragraph tag. Create paragraph, so users can read contents better.
        Even though we press space several times between the contents to divide them into several paragraph,
        there will be only one space (maximum one space) displayed on the web browser.

        Ex) <p>Hello    World</p> (4 times space)
        How it will be displayed in the browser: Hello World (1 space maximum as it is the web browser)

    How to display space for the web browser
        Use &nbsp; (equal to 1 space)
        Ex) <p>Hello&nbsp;&nbsp;World!</p> (double space: &nbsp two times)
        How it will be displayed in the browser: Hello  World! (double space applied)

    <br> tag: Divide contents into several paragraph
    
    -Incorrect usage of <p>-
    ->Trying to print:
        Hello World!
        My name is Tom
    Then, you do:
        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>My name is Tom</p>
    Instead of this, we should:
        <p>Hello World!<br> My name is Tom</p>
    
    <a>: anchor (a tag) use it when we create links for web page.
    Internal link & external link for <a>
    
    -Internal link
        <a href="">(content)</a>
        href element:
            when I click and want to move to the specific element, we use href. Give the ID attribute value of the element including the "#".

            Ex) <a href="#one"> Move to one</a>
                In this case, if we click "Move to one", we will be moved to the location where the ID "one" is located.
            <p id="one" style="margin-top: 1500px;">one</p>
                CSS is included and make blank spaces in order to see if the internal link works fine or not.
            
        
        If we have ever used one specific internal link, it will be displayed with brown color and underline.

        If there is one internal link which has never used, it will be displayed with blue color and underline.
    
    -External link
        <a href="(address for other website)">(Content)</a>

        In this case, you will be moved to other website on the tab you are at. To avoid this,

        <a href="(address for other website)" target="_blank">(Content)</a>
        we add "target" element and you will be able to access the other webpage using a different tab.

    <img src="./Images/Seoul.jpg">
        In the current folder where the index.html is running, find images folder and find the Seoul.jpg file.
        <img> is the tag for uploading the image.
    
    <img src="../Images/Seoul.jpg">
        Double dots. It means the parent folder of Images folder.
    ../ -> the parent folder
    ../../ -> the parent folder of the parent folder
    ../../../ -> the parent folder of the parent folder of the parent folder
    ... keep increasing

    <img src="./Images/Seoul.jpg" alt="The image of Seoul" width="80%" height="400">
        If the image is broken (can't be displayed), it is very important to leave the message explaining what the image is for.
        So, users don't get confused with those images which aren't displayed.
        We use alt="(The content)" for it.

        For  width="80%" height="400", it is for the width and the height for the image.
        80% for width is to get 80% of the original image's width (you can put the number ex: 400)
        and the height value is given.
        Important: Do not put value for width and height such as 150px.

        <img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png">
    </a>
        https://www.google.com/images.. -> this is the resource from the other website (not in our project).
        <img> is under <a href> which means if users click the google image, they will be moved to the website (google).
